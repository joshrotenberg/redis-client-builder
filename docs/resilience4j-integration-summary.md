# Resilience4j Integration Evaluation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the evaluation of integrating [Resilience4j](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j) with the Redis Client Builder library. The evaluation focused on determining the feasibility and approach for adding resilience4j modules to wrap instantiated Redis clients.

## Evaluation Results

The evaluation determined that integrating Resilience4j with Redis Client Builder is feasible and would provide significant value to users by adding fault tolerance capabilities to Redis clients. The integration would allow Redis clients to be wrapped with various resilience4j modules such as Circuit Breaker, Retry, Time Limiter, Bulkhead, and Rate Limiter.

## Integration Approach

The proposed approach is to:

1. Add resilience4j as an optional dependency to maintain the library's lightweight nature
2. Create a resilience module interface that defines how Redis clients can be wrapped with resilience4j modules
3. Extend the existing builder interfaces to support configuring resilience4j modules
4. Update the build() methods to wrap the Redis clients with the configured resilience4j modules

This approach maintains the library's existing fluent API pattern while adding powerful resilience capabilities.

## Required Tasks

The following tasks would be required to implement the resilience4j integration:

1. **Add Dependencies**
   - Add resilience4j-core and module-specific dependencies (circuit-breaker, retry, etc.)
   - Configure them as optional dependencies to avoid forcing users to include them

2. **Create Core Interfaces**
   - Create a `ResilienceModule<T>` interface that defines how a Redis client of type T can be wrapped
   - Create implementations for each resilience4j module (CircuitBreakerModule, RetryModule, etc.)

3. **Extend Builder Interfaces**
   - Add methods to `RedisClientBuilder`, `RedisClusterClientBuilder`, and `RedisSentinelClientBuilder` for configuring resilience modules
   - Example: `withCircuitBreaker(CircuitBreakerConfig)`, `withRetry(RetryConfig)`, etc.

4. **Implement Client Wrapping**
   - Create wrapper classes for each Redis client type that apply the resilience4j decorators
   - Update the build() methods to wrap the Redis clients with the configured resilience modules

5. **Create Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation with examples of how to use the resilience4j integration
   - Include best practices for configuring resilience4j modules for Redis clients

## Benefits

The integration would provide several benefits:

1. **Fault Tolerance**: Makes Redis clients more resilient to failures, improving application reliability
2. **Consistent API**: Provides a consistent way to add resilience across different Redis client libraries
3. **Flexibility**: Allows users to choose which resilience patterns to apply based on their needs
4. **Configurability**: Provides full access to resilience4j configuration options

## Example Usage

The following example shows how a user might configure a Redis client with resilience4j modules:

```kotlin
// Create a Redis client with circuit breaker and retry
val jedisPool = RedisClientBuilderFactory.jedis()
    .host("redis-server")
    .port(6379)
    .withCircuitBreaker(CircuitBreakerConfig.custom()
        .failureRateThreshold(50f)
        .waitDurationInOpenState(Duration.ofMillis(1000))
        .build())
    .withRetry(RetryConfig.custom()
        .maxAttempts(3)
        .waitDuration(Duration.ofMillis(100))
        .build())
    .build()
```

## Conclusion

Integrating Resilience4j with Redis Client Builder would add significant value to the library by providing fault tolerance capabilities. The integration can be implemented in a way that maintains the library's existing fluent API pattern and lightweight nature while adding powerful resilience capabilities.

The tasks required to implement the integration have been added to the project's TASKS.md file under "Future Enhancements".
