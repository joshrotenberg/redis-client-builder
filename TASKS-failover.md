# Redis Client Builder - Failover Feature Tasks

## Core Functionality

### 1. Create Failover Module Structure
- [x] Create a `redis-client-builder-failover` module for the failover feature
- [x] Set up proper dependencies in build.gradle.kts
- [x] Configure the module to be optional to avoid unnecessary dependencies

### 2. Define Core Interfaces in Core Module
- [x] Create `RedisHealthCheck` interface in core module
  - [x] Define methods for health check execution
  - [x] Define methods for health status reporting
  - [x] Define methods for configuration (timeout, retry, etc.)
- [x] Create `RedisHealthCheckRegistry` interface for managing multiple health checks
  - [x] Define methods for registering/unregistering health checks
  - [x] Define methods for querying health check status
- [x] Create `RedisEndpointManager` interface for managing Redis endpoints
  - [x] Define methods for adding/removing endpoints
  - [x] Define methods for querying endpoint status
  - [x] Define methods for selecting healthy endpoints
- [x] Create `RedisFailoverManager` interface as the main entry point
  - [x] Define methods for configuration
  - [x] Define methods for integration with client builders

### 3. Implement Health Check Framework
- [ ] Implement `AbstractRedisHealthCheck` base class using Guava's AbstractScheduledService
  - [ ] Implement scheduling configuration
  - [ ] Implement execution context management
  - [ ] Implement metrics collection
- [ ] Implement common health check types
  - [ ] Implement `PingHealthCheck` for basic connectivity testing
  - [ ] Implement `CommandHealthCheck` for testing specific Redis commands
  - [ ] Implement `HttpHealthCheck` for testing HTTP endpoints
  - [ ] Implement `CompositeHealthCheck` for combining multiple checks

### 4. Implement Endpoint Management
- [ ] Implement `RedisEndpointManagerImpl` for tracking endpoint health
  - [ ] Implement endpoint registration/deregistration
  - [ ] Implement health status tracking
  - [ ] Implement endpoint selection strategies
- [ ] Implement endpoint selection strategies
  - [ ] Implement round-robin selection
  - [ ] Implement random selection
  - [ ] Implement weighted selection based on response time
  - [ ] Implement priority-based selection

### 5. Implement Event Notification System
- [ ] Create event types for health check and failover events
  - [ ] Define `HealthCheckEvent` hierarchy (started, completed, failed)
  - [ ] Define `EndpointStatusChangeEvent` for endpoint status changes
  - [ ] Define `FailoverEvent` for failover actions
- [ ] Implement event publishing mechanism
  - [ ] Create event bus for distributing events
  - [ ] Implement event listener registration
- [ ] Implement metrics collection for health checks
  - [ ] Track response times
  - [ ] Track success/failure rates
  - [ ] Track failover frequency

### 6. Integrate with Client Builders
- [ ] Extend `RedisClientBuilder` interface with failover support
  - [ ] Add methods for configuring failover behavior
  - [ ] Add methods for registering health checks
- [ ] Implement failover-aware client builders
  - [ ] Modify client creation to use healthy endpoints
  - [ ] Implement dynamic endpoint switching

## Testing

### 1. Unit Tests
- [ ] Create unit tests for health check framework
  - [ ] Test scheduling behavior
  - [ ] Test timeout handling
  - [ ] Test metrics collection
- [ ] Create unit tests for endpoint management
  - [ ] Test endpoint registration/deregistration
  - [ ] Test health status tracking
  - [ ] Test selection strategies

### 2. Integration Tests
- [ ] Create integration tests for failover behavior
  - [ ] Test automatic failover when primary endpoint fails
  - [ ] Test recovery when failed endpoint becomes healthy
  - [ ] Test behavior with multiple simultaneous failures

## Documentation

### 1. API Documentation
- [ ] Document all public interfaces and classes
  - [ ] Include usage examples
  - [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Create comprehensive Javadoc/KDoc

### 2. User Guide
- [ ] Create user guide for failover feature
  - [ ] Include setup instructions
  - [ ] Include configuration examples
  - [ ] Include best practices
- [ ] Create examples for common use cases
  - [ ] Basic failover setup
  - [ ] Custom health checks
  - [ ] Advanced configuration

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement service discovery integration
- [ ] Add support for dynamic endpoint addition/removal
- [ ] Implement advanced health check types (data consistency, performance)
- [ ] Add support for geographic routing
- [ ] Implement predictive failover based on performance degradation
