# Redis Client Builder - Failover Feature Tasks

## Core Functionality

### 1. Create Failover Module Structure

- [x] Set up proper dependencies in build.gradle.kts
- [x] Configure the module to be optional to avoid unnecessary dependencies

### 2. Define Core Interfaces in Core Module
- [x] Create `RedisHealthCheck` interface in core module
  - [x] Define methods for health check execution
  - [x] Define methods for health status reporting
  - [x] Define methods for configuration (timeout, retry, etc.)
- [x] Create `RedisHealthCheckRegistry` interface for managing multiple health checks
  - [x] Define methods for registering/unregistering health checks
  - [x] Define methods for querying health check status
- [x] Create `RedisEndpointManager` interface for managing Redis endpoints
  - [x] Define methods for adding/removing endpoints
  - [x] Define methods for querying endpoint status
  - [x] Define methods for selecting healthy endpoints
- [x] Create `RedisFailoverManager` interface as the main entry point
  - [x] Define methods for configuration
  - [x] Define methods for integration with client builders

### 3. Implement Health Check Framework
- [x] Implement `AbstractRedisHealthCheck` base class using Guava's AbstractScheduledService
  - [x] Implement scheduling configuration
  - [x] Implement execution context management
  - [x] Implement metrics collection
- [x] Implement common health check types
  - [x] Implement `PingHealthCheck` for basic connectivity testing
  - [x] Implement `CommandHealthCheck` for testing specific Redis commands
  - [x] Implement `HttpHealthCheck` for testing HTTP endpoints
  - [x] Implement `CompositeHealthCheck` for combining multiple checks

### 4. Implement Endpoint Management
- [x] Implement `RedisEndpointManagerImpl` for tracking endpoint health
  - [x] Implement endpoint registration/deregistration
  - [x] Implement health status tracking
  - [x] Implement endpoint selection strategies
- [x] Implement endpoint selection strategies
  - [x] Implement round-robin selection
  - [x] Implement random selection
  - [x] Implement weighted selection based on response time
  - [x] Implement priority-based selection

### 5. Implement Event Notification System
- [x] Create event types for health check and failover events
  - [x] Define `HealthCheckEvent` hierarchy (started, completed, failed)
  - [x] Define `EndpointStatusChangeEvent` for endpoint status changes
  - [x] Define `FailoverEvent` for failover actions
- [x] Implement event publishing mechanism
  - [x] Create event bus for distributing events
  - [x] Implement event listener registration
- [x] Implement metrics collection for health checks
  - [x] Track response times
  - [x] Track success/failure rates
  - [x] Track failover frequency

### 6. Integrate with Client Builders
- [x] Extend `RedisClientBuilder` interface with failover support
  - [x] Add methods for configuring failover behavior
  - [x] Add methods for registering health checks
- [x] Implement failover-aware client builders
  - [x] Modify client creation to use healthy endpoints
  - [x] Implement dynamic endpoint switching

## Testing

### 1. Unit Tests
- [ ] Create unit tests for health check framework
  - [ ] Test scheduling behavior
  - [ ] Test timeout handling
  - [ ] Test metrics collection
- [ ] Create unit tests for endpoint management
  - [ ] Test endpoint registration/deregistration
  - [ ] Test health status tracking
  - [ ] Test selection strategies

### 2. Integration Tests
- [ ] Create integration tests for failover behavior
  - [ ] Test automatic failover when primary endpoint fails
  - [ ] Test recovery when failed endpoint becomes healthy
  - [ ] Test behavior with multiple simultaneous failures

## Documentation

### 1. API Documentation
- [ ] Document all public interfaces and classes
  - [ ] Include usage examples
  - [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Create comprehensive Javadoc/KDoc

### 2. User Guide
- [ ] Create user guide for failover feature
  - [ ] Include setup instructions
  - [ ] Include configuration examples
  - [ ] Include best practices
- [ ] Create examples for common use cases
  - [ ] Basic failover setup
