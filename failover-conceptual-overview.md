# Redis Endpoint Failover: Conceptual Overview

## Introduction

Redis Endpoint Failover is a library designed to solve a critical challenge in distributed systems: maintaining reliable connections to Redis instances in dynamic environments. It provides a robust framework for managing connections to multiple Redis endpoints, automatically detecting failures, and redirecting traffic to healthy instances without application disruption.

## Core Problem Statement

In modern distributed architectures, applications often need to interact with Redis instances that may:

- Experience temporary network partitions
- Undergo maintenance or restarts
- Scale up or down dynamically
- Be distributed across multiple availability zones or regions
- Participate in active/active or active/passive configurations

Traditional connection approaches often lead to:
- Application errors when Redis instances become unavailable
- Manual intervention required for failover
- Downtime during Redis maintenance or failures
- Inefficient resource utilization
- Complex application-level retry logic

## Key Concepts

### Endpoint Management

The library maintains a registry of Redis endpoints (host/port combinations) that represent the available Redis instances. These endpoints can be:

- Statically defined at startup
- Dynamically added or removed at runtime
- Automatically discovered through service discovery mechanisms

### Health Monitoring

A core capability is continuous health assessment of Redis endpoints:

- Periodic health checks verify Redis instance availability
- Customizable health check logic with various strategies:
  - Simple PING command to verify basic connectivity
  - Specific Redis commands (GET, SET, etc.) to test functionality
  - Custom key/value checks to verify data consistency
  - HTTP endpoint checks for Redis services with REST APIs
  - Composite checks combining multiple verification methods
- Configurable check frequency and timeout thresholds
- Health status tracking (HEALTHY, UNHEALTHY, UNKNOWN)
- Response time measurement for performance-aware routing

### Intelligent Client Selection

When an application needs to perform Redis operations, the library:

- Filters out unhealthy endpoints
- Applies a selection strategy to choose the optimal endpoint
- Provides the application with a client connected to the selected endpoint
- Handles the entire connection lifecycle

### Selection Strategies

Multiple strategies for endpoint selection enable different use cases:

- Round-robin: Distribute load evenly across all healthy endpoints
- Random: Unpredictable distribution for specific workloads
- First available: Prioritize specific endpoints
- Weighted: Consider response times or other metrics
- Custom: Implement application-specific selection logic

### Event Notification

The library provides a rich event system to notify applications about:

- Endpoint health status changes
- Failover events
- Connection establishment and termination
- Health check execution and results

## Architecture Principles

### Client Agnostic

The library is designed to work with any Redis client library:

- Not tied to specific Redis client implementations
- Supports popular clients through dedicated integration modules
- Extensible to support custom or future client libraries

### Minimal Dependencies

The design emphasizes minimal external dependencies:

- Core functionality has minimal requirements
- Optional integrations are separated into modules
- No dependency on specific application frameworks

### Thread Safety

All components are designed for concurrent use:

- Thread-safe client pool and health check mechanisms
- Atomic operations for status updates
- Synchronized access to shared resources

### Configurability

The library offers extensive configuration options:

- Health check intervals and timeouts
- Selection strategy parameters
- Connection pooling behavior
- Event listener registration

## Use Cases

### High Availability Redis Access

Ensure applications can always access Redis data even during instance failures:

- Automatic detection of Redis instance failures
- Seamless redirection to healthy instances
- No application code changes required for failover

### Load Balancing

Distribute Redis operations across multiple instances:

- Spread read operations across replicas
- Balance write operations across instances
- Optimize for locality or response time

### Redis Active-Active Configurations

The library is particularly useful when working with Redis Active-Active configurations:

- Seamlessly handle multi-primary Redis deployments (Redis Enterprise Active-Active)
- Manage connections to multiple conflict-free replicated database (CRDT) instances
- Intelligently route operations to the closest or most responsive instance
- Maintain application availability during cross-region replication delays
- Support geo-distributed applications with local Redis access

### Multi-Region Deployments

Support for geographically distributed Redis instances:

- Prefer local region instances when healthy
- Fail over to remote regions when necessary
- Weighted selection based on network latency

### Maintenance Windows

Enable zero-downtime maintenance of Redis instances:

- Gracefully handle instance restarts
- Automatically detect when instances return to service
- No application impact during Redis maintenance

## Integration Patterns

### Direct Client Access

Applications can request a healthy Redis client on demand:

- Get a client for immediate use
- Return to pool after operation
- No need to handle connection management

### Connection Pool Integration

The library can manage pools of Redis connections:

- Pre-establish connections to healthy endpoints
- Maintain optimal pool sizes
- Automatically refresh connections as needed

### Resilience Pattern Integration

Combine with resilience patterns for enhanced reliability:

- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Retry mechanisms with backoff strategies
- Timeout handling and request limiting

## Monitoring and Observability

The library provides insights into Redis endpoint health:

- Current status of all endpoints
- Historical health check results
- Response time metrics
- Failover events and frequency

## Conclusion

Redis Endpoint Failover addresses the critical need for resilient Redis connections in modern distributed systems. By abstracting the complexities of endpoint health monitoring, selection, and failover, it allows applications to maintain reliable Redis access even in dynamic and failure-prone environments.

The library's modular design, extensibility, and client-agnostic approach make it suitable for a wide range of applications and deployment scenarios, from simple single-region setups to complex multi-region, active/active configurations.
