# Redis Client Builder - Tasks

## Core Functionality
- [x] Add support for Redis Cluster configuration
  - [x] Extend builders to support cluster configuration
  - [x] Add documentation for cluster configuration
- [x] Add support for Redis Sentinel configuration
  - [x] Extend builders to support sentinel configuration
  - [x] Add documentation for sentinel configuration
- [x] Implement connection pooling options for all client libraries
- [x] Add support for SSL/TLS configuration with custom certificates

## Testing
- [x] Add unit tests for all builder classes
- [x] Add integration tests for all Redis client types
- [ ] Add tests for cluster and sentinel configurations
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for different client libraries

## Documentation
- [x] Complete API documentation with examples
- [x] Add more detailed usage examples for each client type
- [ ] Document best practices for Redis client configuration
- [ ] Add migration guide for switching between client libraries
- [ ] Add a GitHub Action to lint and report all Markdown

## Build & CI/CD
- [x] Set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Configure automated testing on multiple JDK versions
- [x] Set up code quality checks (e.g., ktlint, detekt)
- [ ] Configure automated release process
- [ ] Set up dependency vulnerability scanning

## Distribution
- [ ] Publish library to Maven Central
- [ ] Create release notes for each version
- [x] Set up automated documentation deployment
- [ ] Create demo applications showcasing library usage
- [ ] Evaluate the benefits of splitting the project into separate Gradle modules such as core, jedis, lettuce, r4j, etc.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Develop Kotlin coroutines support for asynchronous operations
- [ ] Add resilience4j integration for fault tolerance
  - [x] Add resilience4j as an optional dependency
  - [x] Create a resilience module interface for wrapping Redis clients
  - [x] Implement circuit breaker integration
  - [ ] Implement retry integration
  - [ ] Implement time limiter integration
  - [ ] Implement bulkhead integration
  - [ ] Implement rate limiter integration
  - [ ] Update builder interfaces to support resilience4j configuration
  - [ ] Create comprehensive documentation with examples
